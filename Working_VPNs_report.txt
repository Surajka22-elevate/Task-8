Task 8: Working with VPNs

Objective:
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.

VPN Used:
ProtonVPN (Connected to Netherlands Server)

Steps Performed:
1. Downloaded and installed ProtonVPN.
2. Signed up for a free account and logged in.
3. Connected to a server located in the Netherlands.
4. Verified IP address before and after VPN connection:
   - Before VPN IP: 157.32.43.190
   - After VPN IP: 190.2.149.74
5. Confirmed successful VPN connection by checking changed IP address on whatismyipaddress.com.
6. Opened HTTPS websites (e.g., https://google.com) and confirmed traffic was encrypted (lock icon visible).
7. Disconnected VPN and confirmed IP address reverted to a real ISP IP: 157.32.40.250
8. Researched VPN encryption and privacy features.

Findings:
- VPN successfully masked the original IP address and replaced it with one from the Netherlands.
- HTTPS traffic was encrypted and secure.
- The VPN uses strong encryption standards like AES-256 to protect data.
- Browsing speed slightly reduced while connected to VPN due to encryption overhead.
- Upon disconnection, the IP address returned to 157.32.40.250, confirming the VPN was no longer active.

VPN Benefits:
- Hides real IP address and location
- Encrypts internet traffic
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions
- Protects against network sniffing, especially on public Wi-Fi

VPN Limitations:
- Does not protect against phishing or malware
- Some free VPNs may log data
- May reduce internet speed
- Cannot guarantee 100% anonymity

Conclusion:
Using a VPN enhances privacy and security when browsing online. It is a useful tool for protecting data, especially on unsecured networks. However, users must be aware of its limitations and avoid relying solely on VPNs for complete security.
